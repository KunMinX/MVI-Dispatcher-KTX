Troubleshoot pitfalls story:[《RepeatOnLifecycle + SharedFlow hidden pitfall troubleshooting and handling》](https://blog.devgenius.io/repeatonlifecycle-sharedflow-hidden-pitfall-troubleshooting-and-handling-d22e7c16ab84)

&nbsp;

The last article of ["Jetpack Architecture Component Design Analysis and Improvement Suggestions"](https://medium.com/@kunminx/google-android-official-architecture-example-i-am-waiting-for-you-at-the-starting-line-b4752d97f283) focused on dismantling the design misunderstandings of the "domain layer" of the official architecture, and gave suggestions for improvement - replacing Event-ViewModel with MVI-Dispatcher,

However, some friends said that they not only want MVI-Dispatcher, but also want to see the MVI practice under Kotlin to hedge the fog of various examples.

Therefore, in this issue, we come with MVI-Dispatcher-KTX and carefully polished example projects, I believe you will be refreshed after reading.

# Project Description

I have been focusing on the “business architecture” model for a long time, and the open source components such as [UnPeekLiveData](https://github.com/KunMinX/UnPeek-LiveData) have been experienced in production environments such as QQ Music with over 100 million monthly lives.

In this case, I will show you how MVI-Dispatcher can simplify the otherwise “complicated and error-prone” message distribution process with just a few lines of code.

```Groovy
implementation 'com.kunminx.arch:mvi-dispatch-ktx:6.5.0-beta'
```

&nbsp;

MVI-Dispatcher is applicable to Kotlin, through which,

> 1.Can completely eliminate mutable boilerplate code, no need to write one line
>
> 2.Multiple events can be sent continuously to support MVI scene
>
> 3.High performance fixed length queue, use as you go, run out of it, and never lose events
>
> 4.It can prevent team newbies from indiscriminately using mutableSharedFlow.emit( ) in Activity/Fragment
>
> 5.Developers only need to pay attention to input and output, inject events from the unique entry input (), and observe at the unique exit output ()
>
> 6.If the new team members are not familiar with Flow, SharedFlow, mutable and MVI, they can also automatically realize the development of “one-way data flow” based on the simple and easy-to-understand I/O design of MVI-Dispatcher “single entry + single exit”
>
> 7.It can be seamlessly integrated into jetpack MVVM and other mode projects

# What‘s More

This project is converted from the 100% Java [MVI-Dispatcher](https://github.com/KunMinX/MVI-Dispatcher) project. By comparing the MVI-Dispatcher project horizontally or checking the git commit records, you can quickly understand that after the one-click conversion of Android Studio, in order to make the project 100% follow the Kotlin style/thinking, we also What adjustments need to be done manually.

Different from the experimental examples, MVI-Dispatcher and MVI-Dispatcher-KTX provide the minimum necessary source code implementation to complete a notepad software.

Therefore, through this example, you can also obtain content including:

> 1.Clean code style & standard naming conventions
>
> 2.In-depth understanding of “view controller” knowledge points & correct use
>
> 3.Full use of AndroidX and Material Design
>
> 4.ConstraintLayout Constraint Layout Best Practices
>
> 5.Best Practices for Hex Compound State Management
>
> 6.Excellent User Experience & Interaction Design
